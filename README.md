# Northeastern Covid Testing Project

## Preface
I am not a healthcare professional or epidemiologist. This is a personal project as something to do just for fun. My analysis is my own and in no way should be taken as guidance in this panddemic.

## Introduction
This project aims to answer the question of whether Northeastern University in Boston, MA has an effective Covid strategy. In addition it is used as a way to explore the data and look for trends. This project was created in the fall of 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic continued to get worse, but many colleges had reopened with additional restrictions. Northeastern's strategy involved testing for all students and faculty multiple times a week. It also limited gatherings and required facemasks to be worn at all times on campus. Additionally it implemented it's "NU Flex" learning model which allows students to attend class in person at limited capacity or to attend remotely.
