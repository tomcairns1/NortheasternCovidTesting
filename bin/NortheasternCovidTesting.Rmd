## Overview
The purpose of this script is to scrape the Northeastern University Testing
Dashboard: https://news.northeastern.edu/coronavirus/reopening/testing-dashboard/
and to analyze the transmission rate over the semester.

## Methods

*Scrape the Data*
I cannot scrape this data in R because it is stored in a javascript file. So I
have to first scrape the data using Python and then import the scraped data into
this file.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load the necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(xml2)
```

```{r}
# The URL
nu.url <- 'https://news.northeastern.edu/coronavirus/reopening/testing-dashboard/'

# Read in the file
nutesting <- read_html(nu.url)

# Get to the correct node
#-------------------------
# Get the body nodes

body_nodes <- nutesting %>%
    html_node('body') %>%
    html_children()

table <- nutesting %>%
    html_node('body') %>%
    xml_find_all("//span[contains(@table, 'svelte-w7dofd')]")

```
