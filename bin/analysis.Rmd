## Overview
This file serves as the analysis for the Northeastern Covid Testing data. The
data was scraped from the Northeastern Covid Testing Dashboard and will serve
as the beginning of the analysis. In future versions I will turn this analysis
into a regular R file that I can build a pipeline around.

## Methods
*Import the Data*
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
filepath = '../data/output.csv'
covid_data = read_csv(filepath)
```

*First Pass*
```{r}
covid_data %>%
    mutate(`Positive Rate` = as.double(str_extract(`Positive Rate`, '[0-9]+.[0-9]'))) %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = `Positive Rate`), color = 'firebrick') +
    theme(panel.background = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line()) +
    labs(title = 'Positive Rate at Northeastern Over Fall Semester',
         y = 'Positive Rate (Percent)')
```
