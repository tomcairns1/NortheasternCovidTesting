This is the README file for the Northeastern Covid Testing Project.

As a preface: I am not a healthcare professional or epidemiologist. This is a personal project as something
to do just for fun.

This project aims to answer the question of whether Northeastern University has an effective Covid strategy. The data 
used in this project is taken from the Northeastern Covid Testing dashboard found at the following URL:
https://news.northeastern.edu/coronavirus/reopening/testing-dashboard/
Permission was given by news.northeastern to use the data. 

The first graph shows the trend in positive transmission rates for both the university and the state of Massachusetts.

The second graph (under construction) aims to show the number of positive cases at Northeastern with the expected
number of positive cases assuming Northeastern had the same rate of transmission as the entire state of
Massachusetts.
